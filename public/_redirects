# redirect netlify sitename to your sitename for SEO purposes,
# to avoid duplicate content.  Do this for http and https
# https://react-netflix-clone-f4b4nd.netlify.app/* https://react-netflix-clone-f4b4nd.# netlify.app/:splat 301!
# http://react-netflix-clone-f4b4nd.netlify.app/* http://react-netflix-clone-f4b4nd.netlify.app/:splat 301!

# also redirect http to https for your custom domain.
# Note that netlify automatically redirects to your custom domain from the bare domain (or vice versa), so you only need one rule here.
